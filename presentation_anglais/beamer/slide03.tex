    \frametitle{The tools to build $\left( E,+ \right) $}
    % To lay the foundation of the group we would like to build. We need a couple of tools.
    % Such as:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Projective plane

            % Indeed as we'd see by definitions ecliptics curves are projective geometry's
            % objects.

        \item Projective lines

            % To understand projective plane we need to understand projective lines as they are
            % what generates the projective plane.

        \item Straight and tangent lines

            % That is the two lines that we will need to understand in order to treat each case we
            % would stumble upon studying the law of the group $\left( E , + \right) $.

        \item Rational points

            % That will be the elements of our group. Thanks to them we can compute additions and
            % doubles. That the hearts of our construction.
    \end{itemize}
